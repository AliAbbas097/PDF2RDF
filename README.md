# PDF2RDF
The aim of PDF2RDF (_Portable Document Format(PDF)_ to _Resource Description Format(RDF)_) project is to allow semantic annotation of text, tables, and/or figures contained in static PDF based research publications automatically. As PDFs lack semantic annotation and structuring, and have a unique encoding format, so it is difficult to execute complex query to PDF documents directly and efficiently - but once the information is extracted and annotated in RDF, complex queries may be easily and effectively executed.

# PDF2RDF
Converts Springer LNCS formatted PDFs to RDFs using text processing techniques. 

The aim of PDF2RDF (PDF to RDF or Portable Document Format to Resource Description Format) project is to allow semantic annotation of text, tables, and/or figures contained in static PDF based reasearch publications automatically. As PDFs lack semantic annotation and structuring, and have a unique encoding format, so it is difficult to execute complex query oto PDF documents directly and efficiently - but once the information is extracted and annotated in RDF, complex queries may be easily and effectively executed.

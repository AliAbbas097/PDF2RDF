# PDF2RDF
Converts Springer LNCS formatted PDFs to RDFs using text processing techniques. 

The aim PDF2RDF project is to allow semantic annotation of text, tables, and/or figures contained in PDF based reasearch publications automatically. As PDFs lack semantic annotation and structuring, so it is difficult to query PDFs directly and efficiently - but once the information is extracted and annotated in RDF, complex queries can be effectively performed.

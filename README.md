# PDF2RDF
The aim of PDF2RDF (_Portable Document Format(PDF)_ to _Resource Description Format(RDF)_) project is to allow semantic annotation of text, tables, and/or figures contained in static PDF based research publications automatically. As PDFs lack semantic annotation and structuring, and have a unique encoding format, so it is difficult to execute complex query to PDF documents directly and efficiently - but once the information is extracted and annotated in RDF, complex queries may be easily and effectively executed.

## Current State
As PDF based research publications may be in various formats such as Springer Journal Format, IEEE etc, so PDR2RDF will initially provide conversion from Springer LNCS formatted PDFs to RDFs. The PDF2RDF library is being developed with an extensible design so that other formats can be added in future.
